# Folder structure

```
+---latex   ### Folder with the program to generate latex reports
    
        edit.py
        
    +---benchmark
    +---regressors
    +---tft
```

1. **Benchmark** &#8594; This folder contains all the csv files created by the benchmark mode
2. **Regressors** &#8594; This folder contains all the csv files created by the export of the regressors
3. **Tft** &#8594; This folder contains all the parquet files generated by the tft

# Configuration Steps
1. Select the number of years to predict: *(int)*
```python
    pred_year = 1
```

2. Select the parquet file: *(str)* &#8594; Select the name of the parquet file to import
```python
parquet_file_name = "cutoff2018_pred_2020_train2018_2yea.parquet"
```

3. Select the csv file to compute the 2 years prediciton benchmark in the right way: *(str)* &#8594; The name of the csv file.
For the reports I used [Tad](https://www.tadviewer.com/) to filter the csv with the right year.
```python
benchmark_file_name = "dataset_no_log3.csv"
```

# Run the code
1. Open a terminal and run this line
```
python edit.py
```
